/**
Class Worker is the abstract, base class to be extended by concrete worker classes.

Concrete worker classes use `error` and `finish` function to emit events.

They should guarantee `error` or `finish` is called exactly once.

They must implement/override `run` virtual method.

They can override `cleanup` virtual method for proper destruction.

`start` and `abort` are public (interface) functions.

When aborting, an `EABORT` error is emitted.

> Internally, `this.finished` indicates whether the worker have been finished or not, either due to error or user abort. Concrete worker should check this state after EVERY STEP an asynchronous operation returns to detect finished state early as possible and stop any further actions immediately.
